## 11. Appendix: Key Conceptual Framework

The system implements a "Morpho-Reflective RLHF" paradigm, drawing parallels between biological morphogenesis and symbolic system alignment:

- **Symbolic drift** = morphogenetic cancer
- **Prompts** = bioelectric cues
- **Retraining** = collective tissue repair
- **Attunement Dashboard** = electrophysiological state monitor
- **Error clusters** = damaged symbolic tissue
- **Calibration** = homeostatic regulation

This conceptual framing guides development toward a system that doesn't merely optimize for statistical alignment but maintains coherent symbolic integrity through continuous reflection and adaptation.
