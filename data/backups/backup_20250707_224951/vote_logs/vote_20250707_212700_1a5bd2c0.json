  "selected_completion": "Sure! Here's a simple way to explain it to a 5-year-old:  \n\n**Tyranny** is like having a really mean king or leader who makes all the rules and won\u2019t let anyone say no. If you don\u2019t do what they say, they might punish you\u2014like a bully who\u2019s in charge of everything.  \n\n**Oppression** is when someone (or a group) keeps hurting or being unfair to others over and over, making them feel sad or scared. It\u2019s like if a big kid keeps taking your toys every day and won\u2019t let you play.  \n\nSo, tyranny is about a *mean ruler*, and oppression is about *people being treated badly* for a long time. Both are unfair and make life hard for others.  \n\nWould you like me to explain it with a little story or example? \ud83d\ude0a",
