Title: Dashboard Performance Optimization
Description: Optimize the RLHF dashboard for better performance with large datasets and complex visualizations
Priority: Medium
Status: Pending
Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

The dashboard has been successfully implemented with all required features and visualizations. 
Now we need to optimize its performance to ensure smooth operation with large datasets and complex visualizations.

Key optimization areas:
1. Data loading and processing
2. Visualization rendering
3. UI component efficiency
4. Memory management
5. Caching strategies

Success criteria:
- Dashboard loads within 3 seconds for typical datasets
- Visualizations render smoothly without lag
- Memory usage remains stable during extended use
- No performance degradation with larger datasets
