# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Dashboard Requirements and Visualization Scope [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather and analyze the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to identify the specific visualization tabs and key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be included in the dashboard.
### Details:
Review the PRD thoroughly to extract all necessary details about the dashboardâ€™s purpose, target audience, required data sources, and the types of visualizations needed for each tab. Document these requirements clearly to guide the design and development process.

## 2. Design Dashboard Layout and Visual Hierarchy [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a detailed design of the dashboard layout, focusing on establishing a clear visual hierarchy and logical grouping of visualization tabs as per best practices.
### Details:
Use principles such as placing critical data at the top or left, grouping related data, applying consistent typography and color schemes, and limiting the number of views per tab to enhance usability and clarity. Prepare wireframes or mockups for stakeholder review.

## 3. Develop Core Dashboard Framework and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement the foundational dashboard structure including tab navigation and responsive layout to support multiple visualization tabs.
### Details:
Set up the dashboard framework using the chosen technology stack, ensuring smooth tab switching, consistent styling, and accessibility compliance. Implement navigation controls that allow users to easily switch between visualization tabs.

## 4. Implement Visualization Components for Each Tab [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Develop and integrate the specific data visualizations for each tab as defined in the PRD, ensuring accuracy and performance.
### Details:
Use appropriate charting libraries or custom components to create visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, or KPIs. Connect visualizations to data sources and implement dynamic updates if required.

## 5. Conduct Final Testing and Optimize Dashboard Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the complete dashboard including all visualization tabs, followed by performance optimization and user feedback incorporation.
### Details:
Test for usability, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility, and load times. Optimize data queries and visualization rendering to ensure smooth user experience. Collect feedback from stakeholders and end users to make final adjustments.

## 6. Define Dashboard Requirements and Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the PRD and define the dashboard's structure, required visualization tabs, and user needs.
### Details:
Document the dashboard layout, including the number of tabs, main sections, and key metrics to display. Use best practices for visual hierarchy and logical grouping[3][5].

## 7. Set Up Dashboard Framework and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the basic dashboard framework with navigation controls for switching between visualization tabs.
### Details:
Develop the main dashboard container and navigation tabs. Ensure smooth transitions and intuitive user experience[5].

## 8. Develop Core Visualizations for Each Tab [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main data visualizations for each specified tab according to the requirements.
### Details:
Implement charts, graphs, or tables for each tab. Use appropriate visualization types for the data and ensure clarity and consistency[3][4].

## 9. Integrate Data Sources and Implement Data Binding [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect each visualization to its respective data source and ensure real-time or periodic data updates.
### Details:
Set up data connections, implement data binding, and handle data refresh logic. Ensure data accuracy and performance[3].

## 10. Apply Styling, Accessibility, and Final Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply consistent styling, ensure accessibility, and perform a final review of the dashboard.
### Details:
Implement a style guide, ensure color contrast, font readability, and keyboard navigation. Perform a comprehensive review for usability and completeness[5].
