# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Extract Requirements from rlhf_dashboard_plan.md [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly review the rlhf_dashboard_plan.md document to extract all functional and non-functional requirements for the RLHF Attunement Dashboard.
### Details:
Read the detailed plan to identify key dashboard features, data sources, user interactions, visualization types, and performance criteria. Document these requirements clearly to guide subsequent implementation steps.

## 2. Design the RLHF Dashboard Architecture and UI/UX [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architectural design and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) mockups for the RLHF Attunement Dashboard based on extracted requirements.
### Details:
Define the system components, data flow, and integration points. Design wireframes and prototypes for dashboard layout, controls, and visualizations ensuring usability and clarity for RLHF metrics and insights.

## 3. Implement Backend Data Integration and Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the backend services to collect, process, and serve RLHF-related data to the dashboard frontend.
### Details:
Set up data pipelines to ingest RLHF training metrics, reward model outputs, and other relevant data. Implement APIs or data endpoints to provide processed data in real-time or batch mode as required by the dashboard.

## 4. Develop Frontend Dashboard Components and Visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the frontend components of the RLHF Attunement Dashboard including charts, tables, and interactive elements as per the UI/UX design.
### Details:
Use appropriate frontend frameworks and libraries to implement responsive and dynamic visualizations that reflect RLHF training progress, reward signals, and model performance indicators.

## 5. Test, Deploy, and Document the RLHF Attunement Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing, deploy the dashboard to the target environment, and create user and maintenance documentation.
### Details:
Execute end-to-end testing including performance, security, and usability tests. Deploy the dashboard ensuring proper configuration and monitoring. Document installation steps, usage instructions, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## 6. Review and Analyze rlhf_dashboard_plan.md [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly review the detailed plan document rlhf_dashboard_plan.md to understand all requirements, features, and design specifications for the RLHF Attunement Dashboard.
### Details:
Read through the plan to identify key components such as data sources, UI elements, user interactions, and backend requirements. Document any clarifications needed before implementation.

## 7. Design Dashboard Architecture and Data Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the overall architecture of the RLHF Dashboard including frontend, backend, and data integration layers based on the plan.
### Details:
Define the technology stack, data sources, API endpoints, state management, and how human feedback and RLHF model data will be displayed and updated in the dashboard.

## 8. Implement Backend Services and APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the backend services and APIs required to fetch, process, and serve RLHF-related data to the dashboard frontend.
### Details:
Implement data ingestion, processing logic, and endpoints to support real-time or batch updates of RLHF attunement metrics and feedback data.

## 9. Develop Frontend Dashboard Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the frontend components of the RLHF Attunement Dashboard according to the design, integrating with backend APIs to display data and visualizations.
### Details:
Use appropriate frontend frameworks to create interactive charts, tables, and controls that allow users to monitor RLHF attunement and provide feedback if applicable.

## 10. Test, Validate, and Deploy RLHF Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of the complete RLHF Dashboard, validate functionality against requirements, and deploy to the target environment.
### Details:
Perform system testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing. Fix any bugs or issues found. Prepare deployment scripts and documentation for release.
