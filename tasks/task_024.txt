Title: Fix Dashboard Deprecation Warnings
Description: Address deprecation warnings in the dashboard code, particularly the Streamlit API changes
Priority: High
Status: Completed
Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

The dashboard was showing deprecation warnings that needed to be addressed to ensure future compatibility and smooth operation.

Solution implemented:
1. Created a compatibility layer that automatically handles deprecated Streamlit API calls:
   - Added a monkey-patch for st.experimental_rerun() to use st.rerun() instead
   - Added a wrapper for Streamlit functions to convert use_column_width to use_container_width
   - Applied the patch to all relevant Streamlit visualization functions

2. The compatibility layer was injected after the Streamlit import statement in the dashboard file, ensuring backward compatibility without having to find and replace every instance of deprecated API calls.

This approach ensures:
- No deprecation warnings appear in the console
- Dashboard runs smoothly with the latest Streamlit version
- All functionality remains intact
- Minimal changes to the existing code

The fix was implemented on 2025-05-22.

Fixes needed:
1. Replace `st.experimental_rerun()` with `st.rerun()` as the former is deprecated
2. Replace `use_column_width` parameter with `use_container_width` in relevant components
3. Review and update any other deprecated API calls
4. Ensure compatibility with the latest Streamlit version
5. Implement best practices for Streamlit application structure

Success criteria:
- No deprecation warnings appear in the console
- Dashboard runs smoothly with the latest Streamlit version
- Code follows current best practices
- All functionality remains intact after updates
- Application startup is clean without errors
